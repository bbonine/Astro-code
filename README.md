# Astro-code
Here is a collection of  scripts I threw together during my time as an undergraduate. Keep in mind this is some fairly primitive code from when I was still learning how to use python. It's up here most for posterity. 
Feel free to contact me if you have any questions about these scripts! You can reach me at brettbonine1420@gmail.com

'M20.py' is a script designed to calculate the M20 value of astronomical sources in a .FITS from specified from an input region file. 

'fits2.py' takes those same sources from the input region file and creates a .pdf with thumbnail 'postage stamp' cutouts of the source for visual inspection.

'catalog.py' takes an input catalog of astronomical sources (in this case, galaxies with a measured redshift), selects the ones within a specfied redshift range, and then writes the matching sources to a textfile.

'regmaker.py' creates a region file (see http://ds9.si.edu/doc/ref/region.html for more information) centered on the sources listen on an input text file.
